## brio 0.1.7 (2019-02-15)

### New functions

- `fileExt`: An improved variation on `tools::file_ext`.

### Minor changes

- `basenameSansExt`: Tightened up this function to return `NA` on match failure.
  This behaves simiarly to the new `fileExt` function.
- Switching back from defunct to deprecated for `sanitizeColData`,
  `sanitizeRowData`, `sanitizeRowRanges`, since these functions are still in use
  by bcbioRNASeq v0.2.9.
- Improved NEWS file for previous releases.



## brio 0.1.6 (2019-02-12)

### Minor changes

- Documentation fixes and website improvements.



## brio 0.1.5 (2019-02-11)

This release helps ensure backward compatibility with R 3.4.

### Minor changes

- Bug fix for assert in `transmit`: Need to wrap `isMatchingRegex` in `all` for
  backward compatibility with R 3.4.
- Miscellaneous CI fixes to [Travis CI] and [AppVeyor CI].



## brio 0.1.4 (2019-01-21)

### New functions

These functions have been migrated from [basejump] here to brio, since they
deal specifically with file input/output:

- `atomize`.
- `decode`.
- `encode`.
- `factorize`.

### Removed functions

- Removed `sanitizeColData` and `sanitizeRowData`. May need to add back in a
  future release, but removed for time being.

### Minor changes

- `realpath`: Removed unnecessary assert check using `allHaveAccess`, since
  `normalizePath` already checks for this when `mustWork = TRUE`.
- Added initial code coverage support using [testthat][].



## brio 0.1.3 (2019-12-13)

### Minor changes

- Updated imports to reflect renaming of S4Transformer package to simply
  [transformer][].



## brio 0.1.2 (2019-12-12)

### Minor changes

- Improved `extPattern` to inherit `compressExtPattern`.
- Improved documentation in `import` regarding compressed file handling.
- Split out NAMESPACE imports into `imports.R` file.
- Updated `sanitizeColData` and `sanitizeRowData` to take advantage of exported
  `atomize` function.
- Improved [Travis CI] and [AppVeyor CI] configuration.



## brio 0.1.1 (2019-01-05)

### Minor changes

- Added [Travis CI][] and [AppVeyor CI][] support.
- Improved documention in `import` regarding supported file formats.
- Split out internal importers into separate R files.
- Fixed return value for `pasteURL`.
- Disabled working examples for transmit, since they are failing on [Travis CI].
- Documentation fixes and miscellaneous tweaks to pass build checks.
